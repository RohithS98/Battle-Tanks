# BATTLE TANKS

Game using HTML5, JavaScript, Canvas API

## AIM:
Fire weapons against your opponent to gain points and increase your score. Direct hits will have the most impact and give the tank the most points. The different types of weapons have different speeds and sizes. The weapons with the largest size will have the most impact and thus, point gain is the most but travel shorter distances. Each tank has limited number of moves; so use them carefully. There are a total of 10 rounds. The tank with the most points wins!
